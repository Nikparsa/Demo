# FastAPI Real-time Dashboard - Presentation Script

## Introduction (5 minutes)

### Slide 1: Introduction
"Good morning/afternoon everyone. Today I'll be presenting a real-time data dashboard built with FastAPI, demonstrating how asynchronous programming in Python can significantly improve performance for data-intensive applications."

### Slide 2: The Problem
"Imagine you're building a dashboard that needs data from multiple sources - weather APIs, cryptocurrency prices, stock market data, and server statistics. With traditional synchronous programming, each API call must wait for the previous one to complete, resulting in slow page loads and poor user experience."

### Slide 3: The Solution
"Asynchronous programming with Python's asyncio library and FastAPI framework solves this problem by allowing multiple API calls to run concurrently, without using multiple threads. This results in faster response times and better resource utilization."

## Live Demo (10 minutes)

### Demo 1: Dashboard Overview
"Let me demonstrate the application I've built. This dashboard pulls data from four different simulated APIs and displays them using interactive charts."

_[Show the initial dashboard]_

"The dashboard includes:
- Real-time temperature data from cities worldwide
- Cryptocurrency price information
- Stock market prices
- Server CPU load statistics"

### Demo 2: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Performance
"Now, let's compare synchronous and asynchronous approaches directly."

_[Click "Run Sync Demo" button]_

"Notice how long this takes. Each API call is processed one after another, resulting in a total time that's the sum of all individual API calls."

_[Click "Run Async Demo" button]_

"With the asynchronous approach, all API calls happen concurrently. The total time is roughly equal to the duration of the slowest API call, not the sum of all calls. This is a significant performance improvement."

### Demo 3: Real-time Updates
"FastAPI also makes it easy to implement real-time updates using WebSockets."

_[Click "Connect WebSocket" button]_

"Now the dashboard is receiving continuous updates without refreshing the page. Notice how the connection indicator turned green and each widget shows its last update time and individual API response time."

## Code Walkthrough (10 minutes)

### Slide 4: FastAPI Overview
"FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It's based on standard Python type hints and leverages asyncio for concurrent operations."

### Code Example 1: Async Endpoints
```python
@app.get("/async")
async def get_async_data():
    """Demonstrates fast asynchronous data fetching"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Fetch data from all sources concurrently
    weather_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_weather_data())
    crypto_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_crypto_prices())
    stocks_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_stock_data())
    servers_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_server_stats())
    
    # Await all tasks
    weather = await weather_task
    crypto = await crypto_task
    stocks = await stocks_task
    servers = await servers_task
    
    end_time = time.time()
    
    return {
        "weather": weather,
        "crypto": crypto,
        "stocks": stocks,
        "servers": servers,
        "total_time": round(end_time - start_time, 2)
    }
```

"This code creates tasks for each API call and runs them concurrently. The `await` keyword pauses execution of the function without blocking the entire program, allowing other tasks to proceed."

### Code Example 2: WebSocket Implementation
```python
@app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await manager.connect(websocket)
    try:
        while True:
            # Fetch all data concurrently
            weather_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_weather_data())
            crypto_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_crypto_prices())
            stocks_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_stock_data())
            servers_task = asyncio.create_task(fetch_server_stats())
            
            # Await all tasks
            weather = await weather_task
            crypto = await crypto_task
            stocks = await stocks_task
            servers = await servers_task
            
            # Send update to client
            await manager.send_personal_message(json.dumps(data_packet), websocket)
            
            # Wait before next update
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        manager.disconnect(websocket)
```

"This WebSocket endpoint maintains a persistent connection with the client. It continuously fetches new data asynchronously and pushes updates to the browser without requiring page refreshes."

### Slide 5: How Asyncio Works
"Under the hood, asyncio uses an event loop to manage concurrent tasks. When one task is waiting for I/O (like an API response), the event loop can run other tasks. This is different from threading, which requires multiple execution contexts and introduces overhead."

## Conclusion (5 minutes)

### Slide 6: Key Benefits
"To summarize the key benefits of this approach:
1. **Speed**: Concurrent API calls significantly reduce total response time
2. **Efficiency**: Asyncio achieves concurrency without the overhead of threads or processes
3. **Scalability**: Single-threaded async can handle many more connections than thread-based approaches
4. **Real-time capabilities**: WebSockets enable live updates for modern applications"

### Slide 7: Real-world Applications
"This approach is particularly valuable for:
- Dashboards pulling data from multiple sources
- Microservice architectures with many internal API calls
- High-traffic web applications
- IoT systems with many connected devices"

### Slide 8: Questions?
"I'd be happy to answer any questions about FastAPI, asyncio, or the implementation details of this project."

### Additional Code Example: Mock API with Variable Response Times
```python
async def fetch_weather_data():
    # Simulate API delay between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds
    await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.5, 1.5))
    
    temperatures = {
        "New York": random.randint(0, 32),
        "London": random.randint(-5, 25),
        "Tokyo": random.randint(5, 35),
        "Sydney": random.randint(10, 40),
        "Berlin": random.randint(-2, 30)
    }
    
    return {
        "data": temperatures,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S"),
        "source": "Weather API",
        "response_time": round(random.uniform(0.5, 1.5), 2)
    }
